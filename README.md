# Voizen — Decentralized Voice Network on Solana

Voizen is a next-generation Web3 communication platform that brings privacy, autonomy, and digital identity to voice communication.  
Each user owns an NFT-based digital SIM that unlocks private global calls, encrypted VoIP, and real-time AI voice masking — all without accounts, apps, or KYC.

> Your voice. Your number. Your privacy.

## 🔹 Overview
Voizen merges decentralized communication, NFT identity, and AI voice technology into a unified Web3 ecosystem built on Solana.  
By connecting a wallet and activating an NFT SIM, users gain access to:
- Encrypted global calls  
- Real-time AI voice masking  
- Caller ID spoofing and hidden caller mode  
- NFT-based access and identity layers  
- Staking, cashback, and DAO participation  

Voizen is not a messenger — it’s a privacy-first telecom network for Web3, where users own their number, voice, and data.

## 💼 Revenue Model
Voizen’s economy runs on two real utilities:
1. Subscription Plans — calls, SMS, AI features  
2. Voice Marketplace — AI voice creation and trading  

All income is generated on-chain.  
A share of monthly revenue funds Staking, Connect, and OG Pools, ensuring transparent profit distribution.
